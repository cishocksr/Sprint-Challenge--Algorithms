#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Since the while loop will run exactly n times, the runtime will be O(n).

b) The rate of growth is greater than a linear runtime, so as n increases the increase of the operation is significantly lower than a quadratic runtime. This runtime is O(n log n).

c) O(n) will be the runtime for this function because the function will call itself n times. This is generally the case when a recursive function with only one recursice call and no extra looping.
